This application is currently under development until October 2024.

The purpose of the StreamFlix application is to create a local server that you can connect to from another device to watch specific videos/movies with or without subtitles. 
It’s like a local ‘Netflix’ where you upload your own videos and subtitles, and everything necessary, allowing you to connect from any device on the same network to watch them.
